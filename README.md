OPERATION ORDER
Manual security assessments against large network ranges are
slow, error-prone, and inconsistent. Repetitive authentication
testing and post-access validation consume time and introduce
operational mistakes. This project focuses on building a fully
automated framework to identify exposed SSH services, validate
access controls under controlled conditions, and execute
predefined verification tasks without manual interaction.
